## Rock, Paper, Scissors

My entry for the Odin Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors.

### Functionality

End goal is to create a simple web page to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer.

A count of total wins for player and computer will be displayed and the first to 5 wins will be declared THE WINNER!
